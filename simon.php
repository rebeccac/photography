			<p>Perhaps it’s a good thing I can’t paint. If I could, I suspect I might spend my days sketching in 
			cafes or shut up in the safety of my room with a brush. As it is, that I’m so afflicted, I’ve turned 
			instead to photography as my expressive medium.<br><br></p>

			<p>My attitude is that, in general, photography is the lesser art relative to painting. Although, with 
			no other reasoning beside my own opinion, I believe a great photographer can aspire to great art in a 
			way a painter never could.<br><br></p>

			<p>For it’s one thing to sit in the shade of a tree or hidden in the confines of a studio; yet quite 
			another to risk the desolate and despised place, the cold, the heat and grime, to capture the beauty 
			in the lonely thing, the dangerous or forgotten thing.<br><br></p>

			<p>For me, photography allows the inexpressible facet to be polished, seen and felt.<br><br></p>

			<p>I hope you feel it too.
